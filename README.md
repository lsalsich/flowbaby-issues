# Flowbaby Issues

Welcome to the **public issue tracker** for [Flowbaby](https://flowbaby.ai) — the AI-powered memory and context management system for VS Code.

Flowbaby helps developers maintain perfect context across coding sessions by automatically capturing decisions, progress, and reasoning, then making that knowledge retrievable through natural language. This repository is where you can report bugs, request features, ask questions, and engage with the Flowbaby community.

> **Note**: The core Flowbaby implementation is maintained in a private repository. This public repo is dedicated to community interaction, issue tracking, and roadmap visibility.
